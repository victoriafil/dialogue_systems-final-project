you're at the supermarket and you want to buy two any kinds of fruit, eggs, bread and butter. You only have 5 minutes before the store closes. A shop assistant is approaching you ....

find a way to display pictures of things you need to buy and/or cross out the picture of the word someoen says
add a timer

show one picture at a time and move to the next state if the player asked for the right thing

maybe add bonus products if there is time left? i.e.
if (time>2min)
	show more pictures or go to the cashier?

keep score
shop for bonus points
if time runs out say something like:
		please hurry up! the store is closing
